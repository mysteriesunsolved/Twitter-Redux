# Twitter# Project 4 - *Name of App Here*

**Name of your app** is a basic twitter app to read and compose tweets the [Twitter API](https://apps.twitter.com/).

Time spent: **15** hours spent in total

## User Stories

The following **required** functionality is completed:

- [x] User can sign in using OAuth login flow
- [x] User can view last 20 tweets from their home timeline
- [x] The current signed in user will be persisted across restarts
- [x] In the home timeline, user can view tweet with the user profile picture, username, tweet text, and timestamp.
- [x] Retweeting and favoriting should increment the retweet and favorite count.

The following **optional** features are implemented:

- [ ] User can load more tweets once they reach the bottom of the feed using infinite loading similar to the actual Twitter client.
- [ ] User should be able to unretweet and unfavorite and should decrement the retweet and favorite count.
- [ ] User can pull to refresh.

The following **additional** features are implemented:

- [ ] List anything else that you can get done to improve the app functionality!
- I added animations to the tweet and retweet buttons

Please list two areas of the assignment you'd like to **discuss further with your peers** during the next class (examples include better ways to implement something, how to extend your app in certain ways, etc):

1. Autolayout and more on Api calls like untweeting etc
2. NSDates and conversions

## Video Walkthrough 

Here's a walkthrough of implemented user stories:

## Notes

Describe any challenges encountered while building the app.
I had trouble with the autolayout and I think I ran out of network api requests so I haven't been able to create a gif or issue yet.
